The command lets you quickly search gitmojis icons defined here from [Gitmoji.dev](https://gitmoji.dev).

Copy/Paste git emoji characters, for your commit messages.
ðŸ˜œ Gitmoji is an emoji guide for GitHub commit messages. Aims to be a standarization cheatsheet - guide for using emojis on GitHub's commit messages.

Using emojis on commit messages provides an easy way of identifying the purpose or intention of a commit with only looking at the emojis used. As there are a lot of different emojis I found the need of creating a guide that can help to use emojis easier.
